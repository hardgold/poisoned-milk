Everything i say is right


I vaguely remember that on November 9, 2016, when I was still lying in bed, my roommate asked me to guess who was elected President of the United States. I did not hesitate to say that it was Hillary. She was familiar with politics and supported by former presidents like Clinton and Obama. How could she lose the election? But my roommate told me Trump won the election

Biden and Trump are running for the new president. Trump has countless fans, and of course, many people hate him. Voters seem to have only two sides. One side supports Trump, and the other side hates Trump. Nobody cares who is Biden. I was wondering how Trump could lose the election. The results came out that Biden was elected President of the United States on November 8, 2020


Today（November 16， 2022），Trump officially announced his re-election to the President of the United States. My thought is how Trump can win. He can't win and  he won't invite me to his inauguration.  -- 11:26 11/16/2022 CST（Beijing）
